Dekko
=====

Dekko is a modified version of the regular weight of Modular InfoTech's 4948. 
The new version appears somewhat more written and also more regular in appearance and weight. 
The spacing of the design is now wider allowing for it to be used at smaller sizes on screens. 
Dekko also comes with a complete set of Latin which matches the Devanagari in weight and and size. 
Both the Devanagari and the Latin are based on written forms. The contrast makes for think horizontals. 
The pen angles associated Deva has some diagonal stress. The Latin script Glyphs use a vertical stress.
Dekkoâ€™s personality is both warmly casual.
